***Problem Difficulty*** (count with star)

1. you can solve w/o the brain
2. you can solve if you think a bit
3. you can solve if you think carefully
4. you might solve if you push yourself
5. you can solve if you use other's brain

**YOU NEED TO SOLVE FORMALLY** especially in this chapter

## Exercise

***3.1-1*** $\star\star$

Using the basic definition of $\Theta$-notation, prove that

$$ \max{\left ( f(n), g(n) \right ) } = \Theta(f(n) + g(n)) $$

***3.1-2*** $\star\star$

Show that for any real constants $a$ and $b$, where $b > 0$,

$$ (n+a)^b = \theta(n^b) $$

***3.1-4*** $\star\star$

Is $2^{n+1} = O(2^n)$? Is $2^{2n} = O(2^n)$

***3.1-5*** $\star\star\star$

Prove that(***Theorem 3.1***), For any two functions $f(n)$ and $g(n)$, we have $f(n) = \Theta(g(n))$ if and only if $f(n) = O(g(n))$ and $f(n) = \Omega(g(n))$
