## Notifications

Selectino in worst-case linear time is little tricky. You need to study carfully.

***Problem Difficulty*** (count with star)

1. you can solve w/o the brain
2. you can solve if you think a bit
3. you can solve if you think carefully
4. you might solve if you push yourself
5. you can solve if you use other's brain

## Exercise

***9.1-1*** $\star\star\star$

Show that the second smallest of $n$ elements can be found with $n + \lceil \lg n \rceil - 2$ comparisions in the worst case.

> **Hint :** what are the candidates of the second smallest element if we find the smallest element in linear time

***9.2-4*** $\star\star$

Suppose we use $\text{R}{\scriptsize \text{ANDOMIZED}}$-$\text{S}{\scriptsize \text{ELECT}}$ to select the minimum element of the array $A = \langle 3, 2, 9, 0, 7, 5, 4, 8, 6, 1\rangle$. Describe a sequence of partitions that results in a worst-case performance of $\text{R}{\scriptsize \text{ANDOMIZED}}$-$\text{S}{\scriptsize \text{ELECT}}$.

***9.3-1*** $\star\star\star$

In the algorithm $\text{S}{\scriptsize \text{ELECT}}$, the input elements are divided into groups of 5. Will the algorithm work in linear time if they are divided into groups of 7? Argue that $\text{S}{\scriptsize \text{ELECT}}$ does not run in linear time if groups of 3 are used.

***9.3-4*** $\star\star\star\star$

Suppose that an algorithm uses only comparison to find the $i$th smallest element in a set of $n$ elements. Show that it can also find the $i-1$ smaller elements and the $n-i$ larger elements without performing any additional comparisons.


***9.3-7*** $\star\star\star\star$

Describe an $O(n)$-time algorithm that, given a set $S$ of $n$ distinct number s and a positive integer $k \le n$, determines the $k$ numbers in $S$ that are closest to the median of $S$.

***9.3-8*** $\star\star\star\star$

Let $X[1..n]$ and $Y[1..n]$ be two arrays, each contatining $n$ numbers already in sorted order. Give an $O(\lg n)$-time algorithm to find the median of all $2n$ elements in arrays $X$ and $Y$.
