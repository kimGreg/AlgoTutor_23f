Quicksort is similar to mergesort but has many different interesting features.

## Notifications

***Problem Difficulty*** (count with star)

1. you can solve w/o the brain
2. you can solve if you think a bit
3. you can solve if you think carefully
4. you might solve if you push yourself
5. you can solve if you use other's brain

## Exercise

***7.1-1*** $\star\star$

Using Figure 7.1 as a model, illustrate the operation of $\text{P}{\scriptsize \text{ARTITION}}$ on the arry $A = \langle 13, 19, 9, 5, 12, 8, 7, 4, 21, 2, 6, 11 \rangle$.

***7.1-3*** $\star\star$

Give a brief argument that the running time of $\text{P}{\scriptsize \text{ARTITION}}$ on a subarray of size $n$ is $\Theta(n)$

***7.2-2*** $\star\star$

What is the running time of $\text{Q}{\scriptsize \text{UICKSORT}}$ when all elements of array $A$ have the same value?

***7.2-3*** $\star\star$

What is the running time of $\text{Q}{\scriptsize \text{UICKSORT}}$ when all elements of array $A$ have the same value?

***7.2-6*** $\star\star\star$

Argue that for any constant $0 < \alpha \le 1/2$, the probability is approximately $1-2\alpha$ that on a random input array, $\text{P}{\scriptsize \text{ARTITION}}$ produces a split more balanced than $1-\alpha$ to $\alpha$

***7.4-1*** $\star\star\star$

Show that in the recurrence

$$T(n) = \max_{0\le q\le n-1}{(T(q) + T(n-q-1))} + \Theta(n)$$

***7.4-4*** $\star\star\star$

Show that the $\text{R}{\scriptsize \text{ANDOMIZED}}$-$\text{Q}{\scriptsize \text{UICKSORT}}$'s expected running time is $\Omega(n \lg n)$

***7.4-6*** $\star\star\star\star$

Consider modifying the $\text{P}{\scriptsize \text{ARTITION}}$ procedure by randomly picking three elements form array $A$ and partitioning about their median (the middle value of the three elements). Approximate the probabilitu of getting at worst an $\alpha$-to-$(1-\alpha)$ split, as a function of $\alpha$ in the rans $0 < \alpha < 1$

## Problems

***7.1 Hoare partition correctness*** $\star\star\star$

> **Note :** sample implementation code of quick sort using this partition method


```
HOARE-PARTITION(A, p, r)
x = A[p]
i = p - 1
j = r + 1
while TRUE
  repeat
    j = j - 1
  until A[j] <= x
  repeat
    i = i + 1
  until A[i] >= x
  if i < j
    exchange A[i] with A[j]
  else return j
```

***a.*** Demonstrate the operation of $\text{H}{\scriptsize \text{OARE}}$-$\text{P}{\scriptsize \text{ARTITION}}$ on the arry $A = \langle 13, 19, 9, 5, 12, 8, 7, 4, 11, 2, 6, 21 \rangle$, showing the values of the array and auxiliary valuees after each iteration of the **while** loop in lines 5-14

***b.*** Prove it, the indices $i$ and $j$ are such that we never access an element of $A$ outside the subarrya $A[p..r]$


***c.*** Prove it, when $\text{H}{\scriptsize \text{OARE}}$-$\text{P}{\scriptsize \text{ARTITION}}$  terminates, it returns a value $j$ such aht $p \le j < r$

***d.*** Prove it, every element of $A[p..j]$ is less than or equal to every element of $A[j+1..r]$ when $\text{H}{\scriptsize \text{OARE}}$-$\text{P}{\scriptsize \text{ARTITION}}$  terminates.
